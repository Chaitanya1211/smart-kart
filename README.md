# Smart Kart

## Introduction

This system was created using the Flutter framework, which uses the Dart programming language, and Firebase as the database. Google's Flutter is an open-source user interface software development kit. It is used to create cross-platform applications from a single codebase for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web. Google's Firebase technology allows developers to create mobile and online applications. It started off as a stand-alone business in 2011. Google bought the platform in 2014, and it is now their main option for app creation. It is a NoSql database which works in document format

The project's main database is Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL database that uses collections and documents. Only Firebase's login and registration functionality is used.
