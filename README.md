# smart_kart

A new Flutter project.

I've provided a code sample for an Android application created in Dart with the flutter framework. This programme was created to simplify users' mall shopping experiences. The user scans the QR code printed on the merchandise using the application, much like a self-billing system. All of the product information, including price, is contained in the QR code. As the user continues to scan things, a total bill is generated, and when the user is done shopping, there is a checkout option that sends them to the payment gateway. Razorpay is the integrated payment gateway, and it offers a variety of payment methods.

The project's main database is Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL database that uses collections and documents. Only Firebase's login and registration functionality is used.
